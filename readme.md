This repository contains software I authored for Lumialis, LLC that was used in the commercial iPhone application, "MatteSpect."  This was a photo decorating app that let you create backgrounds for your photos, as well as decorate them with drawing and other effects.  

As the first quarter of 2015 ended, so did my association with Lumialis. But before I left, Lumialis and I entered a discussion wherein we agreed that releasing a fork of the App's source code (as it was at that time) under a non-commercial open source license would be a great way to give back to the software community.  So here it is!

I feel this will be interesting for students, or people wanting to look at an in-development snapshot of the source code of a commercially released mobile application.

Some important things to note: 
-This software is the copyrighted intellectual property of Lumialis, LLC.  I am distributing it under license from them.  
-This source code release is not MatteSpect, and MatteSpect is not open source.  This is a forked codebase from an in-development snapshot of the app as it was when my association with Lumialis ended. Therefore, this release has been stripped of all the layouts, project files, and trademarks affiliated with Lumialis' intellectual property.  It also includes no revisions that Lumialis may have made internally since this code was forked.  None of that intellectual property is included in this license, so please do not infringe on any of Lumialis' intellectual property that is not included with this distribution.
-The license granted basically lets you do whatever you want with the source, as long as it's for non-commercial purposes.  If you're a student looking for a great portfolio piece, you can make your own photo decoration app using this code as a jumping off point and even put it on the App Store so long as you don't monetize.  
-I was the author of all the source codes included in this repository.  I can field any questions about the software itself.  
-I am no longer affiliated with Lumialis, so questions about MatteSpect, alternative licensing, or other questions about Lumialis' products and software should be directed at Lumialis.
-Please read the license if you're not sure about anything!  

Happy coding!
